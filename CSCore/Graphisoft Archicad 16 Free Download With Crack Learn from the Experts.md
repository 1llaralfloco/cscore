Here are some more paragraphs for your article:
 
Archicad 16 is a BIM (Building Information Modeling) software that allows you to create and manage the entire life cycle of a building project. You can design, document, analyze, and collaborate with other professionals using ArchiCAD 16. ArchiCAD 16 supports various file formats and standards, such as DWG, DXF, IFC, PDF, BCF, and more. You can also integrate ArchiCAD 16 with other software and tools, such as Google Earth, Cinema 4D, MEP Modeler, and more.
 
One of the main features of ArchiCAD 16 is the MORPH TOOL, which lets you create custom 3D objects and shapes without any limitations. You can use the MORPH TOOL to model complex forms, such as organic shapes, sculptures, furniture, ornaments, and more. You can also edit the morphs by changing their texture, color, material, transparency, and other properties. You can also convert any existing element into a morph or merge multiple morphs into one.
 
Another feature of ArchiCAD 16 is the BIM-components system, which allows you to create and search user objects that can be used in your projects. You can access thousands of BIM-components from Graphisoft's online database or create your own using the Object Tool. You can also share your BIM-components with other users or download them from other sources. BIM-components are smart objects that have parametric properties and behaviors that can adapt to different situations and contexts.
