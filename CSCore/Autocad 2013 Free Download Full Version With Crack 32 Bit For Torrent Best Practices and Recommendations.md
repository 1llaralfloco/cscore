## Tip 2: Use Keyboard Shortcuts
 
Keyboard shortcuts are a great way to speed up your work and save time. Autocad 2013 has many keyboard shortcuts that you can use to perform common commands and actions. For example, you can press "Ctrl+S" to save your file, "Ctrl+Z" to undo your last action, or "Ctrl+F" to find text.
 
To view a list of keyboard shortcuts, go to the "Help" tab and click on "Find". Then type "keyboard shortcuts" in the search box and press "Enter". A list of keyboard shortcuts will appear in the browser window. You can also access this list by pressing "F1" on your keyboard and typing "keyboard shortcuts" in the search box.
 
You can also create your own keyboard shortcuts by editing the "acad.pgp" file. This file contains the aliases and commands that are associated with each keyboard shortcut. To edit this file, go to the "Manage" tab and click on "Edit Aliases". A text editor will open where you can modify the file. Be careful not to change or delete any existing aliases or commands unless you know what you are doing.
 
## Tip 3: Use Dynamic Input
 
Dynamic input is a feature that displays command prompts, options, and values at your cursor location. This allows you to enter commands and data without looking at the command line or dialog boxes. Dynamic input also provides tooltips, dimensions, angles, and other information as you draw or modify objects.
 
To enable dynamic input, go to the "Status Bar" and click on the "Dynamic Input" button. You can also press "F12" on your keyboard to toggle dynamic input on or off. When dynamic input is enabled, you will see a small icon next to your cursor that indicates the current mode of input.
 
You can customize dynamic input by right-clicking on the "Dynamic Input" button on the status bar and selecting "Settings". A dialog box will appear where you can adjust various options and preferences. For example, you can choose what type of information to display, how to format it, and how to enter it.
